# Benny-Scraper
Webscraper that sets out make listening to webnovels easier for myself. Turned into project that let users store all chapters of their favorite Mangas or Webnovels offline in one file. Creates Epubs, at this moment, the goal is to make adding other sites extremely easy using the `appsettings.json` in Benny-Scraper project

MangaKatana is currently the best site to get mangas as the others scramble the chapter images, I can only assume they are owned by the same people and will need to find a way to unscramble it.

# TO DO
- [x] Figure out how to properly construct an Epub. https://validator.w3.org/check for chapter validations
- [x] Code rewrite so process from Scraper to Epub works
- [x] Update code to accommodate more novel sites
- [x] Switch from SQL to MySql to embedd database
- [x] Test on computers without sql installed
- [x] Test on Linux machine - in this Case Ubuntu 20.04-x64
- [x] Add Calibre integration - completed novels will be added to the Calibredb if it is installed on host computer
- [ ] Verify the update novel works
- [ ] Finish up Selenium Scraper -- UPDATE: use of seleniumn was necessary when trying to retrieve images from manga sites, it is still faster to use http for NovelData (things such as tags and author)
- [x] Try Manga sites
- [ ] Add UI
- [ ] Make changes to database, use ints instead of unique identifiers as Shane mentioned. Guid should be used from the outside in, where someone wants to get data through an api, for that having the main id be a int and having a column like UUID which is the guid that will be used to find the item.
- [ ] Create Documentation, especially for trying to add a new Scraper Strategy for new sites

## Getting Started
https://www.webnovelpub.com/
https://www.novelfull.com/
1. For both sites, the url for the `Table of Contents` page for the novel is needed. 
2. *Note* : all epubs will be stored in you Documents folder BennyScrapedNovels/{Novel Name} . Get an epub reader to read the contents, chrome extensions are available like `EPUB Reader`
3. Click a novel and copy the url at the top ![chrome_Y234bE9Ce6](https://github.com/martial-god/PageShaver/assets/8980094/31b6190b-439a-4550-aaf3-3b05b3c24a13)![chrome_044SXb9GQL](https://github.com/martial-god/PageShaver/assets/8980094/579ffd1b-f5fb-4a1a-9d30-b83a9c743ca2)

4. Paste copied url into application, then wait until message about epub has been generated. Speed depends on server response of the site. ![cmd_R4W67LuIR7](https://github.com/martial-god/PageShaver/assets/8980094/d682f498-54f3-40b1-ba6b-4998bd14b863)

5. SPEED HAS ALSO BEEN LIMITED TO 2 CUNCURRENT REQUEST. To change this change the variable `ConcurrentRequestLimit` Benny_Scraper.BusinessLogic.Scrapers.Strategy.ScarperStrategy, the rebuild. The limit was due to certain sites bot protection measures.

So long as the error isn't highlighted while the application is running, they are just Warnings or Errors. Nothing Fatal
