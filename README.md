# Benny-Scraper
Webscraper that sets out make listening to webnovels easier for myself. Creates Epubs, at this moment, the goal is to make adding other sites extremely easy using the `appsettings.json` in Benny-Scraper project

# TO DO
make changes to database, use ints instead of unique identifiers as Shane mentioned. Guid should be used from the outside in, where someone wants to get data through an api, for that having the main id be a int and having a column like UUID which is the guid that will be used to find the item.
